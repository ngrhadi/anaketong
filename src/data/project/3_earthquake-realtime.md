<div class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Description</div>

**IDN EARTHQUAKE REALTIME** is a full-stack application that provides **real-time earthquake information** with timestamp visualizations. Deployed on **Vercel**, the application leverages data from the **Indonesian Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency (BMKG)** to deliver up-to-date seismic activity reports. This project aims to enhance public awareness and preparedness by providing accessible and timely earthquake information.

The system is built using **Next.js** for server-side rendering and dynamic web applications, **OpenLayers** for interactive map visualizations, and **PostgreSQL** for robust data storage. The application is developed in **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and scalability. The application is accessible at <span class="underline underline-offset-1 font-semibold">[https://earthquake-maps.vercel.app/](https://earthquake-maps.vercel.app/)</span>.

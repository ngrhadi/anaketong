<div class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Description</div>

**Digitizing App** is an **internal GIS application** designed to streamline the **digitization and validation process** of spatial data. It serves as a crucial tool for ensuring **data accuracy** and **workflow efficiency** for digitization teams. The app seamlessly integrates with **ArcGIS** and a **PostgreSQL** database to automate validation processes, reducing human errors and improving **spatial data precision**.

This application automates **vector validation** by checking **line length, precision, and snapping accuracy**, while also allowing **manual digitization and edits** within the system.
